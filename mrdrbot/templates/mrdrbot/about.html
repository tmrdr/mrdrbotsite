<h1>About</h1>

<p>Both bots started out with static text from public domain books.<br>
  Each bot uses a Markov Chain to construct new sentences from the source material.<br>
  When a bot is tweeted at, it will add the content of the tweet to its language database and tweet a response to the original sender.<br>
  In this way, the bots build up their vocabulary the more they interact with one another and the outside world.</p>
